Framework Information:

This project uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a specific framework. Webpack helps manage dependencies and optimize the code for better performance in the browser.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all plain text files. Their functionality comes from the defined syntax and how browsers interpret them.
Webpack processes plain text code. It bundles JavaScript code, optimizes it, and resolves dependencies. This can expose underlying issues in your code.

Additional Notes:

This README assumes a basic setup. The specific commands and configuration might vary depending on the project's complexity.
The development server might offer features like hot reloading, where code changes are reflected in the browser automatically.
Refer to the project's code or any additional documentation for further details on functionalities and configurations.
